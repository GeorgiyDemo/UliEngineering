A python library for calculations perfomed in electronics engineering.

This project is still in pre-alpha and only contains a collection of electronics functionality from [techoverflow.net](http://techoverflow.net). The python package itself has not been built or published yet.

This project is based on these two blogposts:
* [Normalizing electronics engineering value notations using Python](http://techoverflow.net/blog/2015/06/09/normalizing-electronics-engineering-value-notations-using-python/)
* [Finding the nearest E96 resistor value in Python](http://techoverflow.net/blog/2015/05/19/finding-the-nearest-e96-resistor-value-in-python/)

Over time, the amount of source code related to electronics calculations grew too large to maintain as a set of blogposts

Pull requests and bugreports of any kind are happily accepted.
